# WebViewer - Cordova sample

[WebViewer](https://www.apryse.com/webviewer) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse PDF SDK](https://apryse.com/products/core-sdk/pdf). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.
